# Toast Setup Instructions

## The Problem
The shadcn CLI couldn't find the toast component at the specified registry URL. This is a common issue with shadcn registry paths.

## Solution
I've manually created all the toast components for you. No need to use the shadcn CLI for toast!

## What's Included

✅ **`components/ui/toast.tsx`** - Complete toast UI components
✅ **`components/ui/toaster.tsx`** - Toast container component  
✅ **`hooks/use-toast.ts`** - Toast hook with full functionality
✅ **Updated `app/layout.tsx`** - Toaster added to root layout

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the Required Dependency
\`\`\`bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-toast
\`\`\`

### 2. That's It!
All the toast components are already included in the project files. No need to run any shadcn commands.

## How to Use Toasts

\`\`\`tsx
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast"

function MyComponent() {
  const { toast } = useToast()

  const showToast = () => {
    toast({
      title: "Success!",
      description: "Your action was completed.",
    })
  }

  const showError = () => {
    toast({
      title: "Error",
      description: "Something went wrong.",
      variant: "destructive",
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={showToast}>Show Success</button>
      <button onClick={showError}>Show Error</button>
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Features

- ✅ **Auto-dismiss functionality**
- ✅ **Smooth animations**
- ✅ **Mobile responsive**
- ✅ **Accessible with ARIA**
